UIKit Improvements
==================
Sometimes, Apple's UIKit classes don't enable you to customize the views the
way you want. That's where our improvements come in.

This is a collection of Xcode projects consisting of categories and subclasses
that have been designed to be easy to use.

To see these improvements "in the wild", just take a look at our apps! More

 * **QALabel**  
   Subclass of `UILabel` that adds a vertical alignment property. In Interface
   Builder, insert a regular label, then set its class to `QALabel` and change
   the vertical alignment in, e.g., your view controller.
